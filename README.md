# CUBs

Scripts for using R ENC'. A metric to quantify codon usage bias selection in prokaryote genomes. If you want to run them, please follow the instructions specified in each script.

## CUBs_max.sh
Script for calculation of tAI and Nc' and other tables requieres for RENC_super.r.

## RENC_super.r
Script with functions for calculating R ENC', Codon usage bias selection (tAI and NC') on Gene Ontology categories, and also for doing GSEA in GO categories. It uses outputs from CUBs_max.sh
